This plugin generates two quicktags on the post/page editors. One is the easy html encoder and the other is the easy mp3 code embed tag.

== Description ==

This a basic quicktag addition for "two" quicktags that I needed for my plugin and then some. But anyway its a html encoder and an easier way to generate shortcode for my MP3 Player Plugin for Wordpress.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `myquicktags.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And thats it quicktags should show up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this a good plugin? =

Its more of a convenience thing because I was doing a lot repetitive things on my blog for updating and displaying the mp3_embed code. Wordpress parses the "[" brackets and therefore all of my code that I was trying to help people with was not coming up with code but instead the actual mp3 player.
